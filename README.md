AB Testing
-----------

Task statement:
--------------
  You've received an analytical task from an international online store. 
  Your predecessor failed to complete it: they launched an A/B test and then quit (to start a watermelon farm in Brazil). 
  They left only the technical specifications and the test results.

Technical description:
------------
  - Test name: recommender_system_test
  - Groups: А (control), B (new payment funnel)
  - Launch date: 2020-12-07
  - The date when they stopped taking up new users: 2020-12-21
  - End date: 2021-01-01
  - Audience: 15% of the new users from the EU region
  - Purpose of the test: 
  Testing changes related to the introduction of an improved recommendation system
  - Expected result: 
  within 14 days of signing up, users will show better conversion into product page views (the product_page event), 
  product card views (product_card) and purchases (purchase). At each of the stage of the funnel product_page → product_card → purchase, there will be at least a 10% increase.
